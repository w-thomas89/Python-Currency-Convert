# Python-Currency-Convert

This will scrape x-rates.com for current currency conversions of the most popular currencies. If a connection to the website cannot be established, the program will read from a locally created data file that gets created each time a connection is established and updated. A GUI interface allows selection of which currency you would like to convert to/from via a simple drop-down menu
